Comment: The tictac code I submitted gets rid of the last blank line when unique boards are 
printed so that the printout matches exactly what the output format looks like. However, if
the key for grading actually has the last blank line instead, you can use an alternative line
of code commented out in the printResults method, which should add an additional blank line. 

Overall, I learned a lot from the TTT assignment not only through designing my own methods
to achieve the required output, but also through checking the original recursive codes from 
which I was aware of another type of implementation of recursion. 

Inconsistent with what Dr.Hewner mentioned in Piazza, System.out.println cannot write things
into a file. It just displays information in the console as it generally does.
