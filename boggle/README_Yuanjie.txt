Comment: This assignment is the one I spent the most time so far. "qu" part is a little 
confusing. Hopefully the instructions can be modified such that it is more clear. 

I did the extra credit by creating CompressedTrieLexicon. It was a little tricky because
I needed to change a lot of methods and data inherited from the super class TrieLexicon.
It would be great if someone could tell me if there is an easier way to construct the 
CompressedTrieLexicon.
