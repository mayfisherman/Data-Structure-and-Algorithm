Comment: The Dna assignment is impressive because it seems to stem from some real biological 
problems. However, there is actually inconsistency between background information and what 
the code is doing, i.e. the splicee is supposed to insert rather than replace the enzyme 
recognition sequence. Overall it provides a chance to practice Linked lists and understand 
its advantages in saving time and memory when a list needs to include many repetitive elements. 

By the way, we did the extra credit part by creating a HashMap storing unique strings as keys
and their corresponding reverse strings as values. If a string appears again in the Linked list, 
our code retrieves its reverse string from the HashMap instead of calling the .reverse method, 
thus saving memories for making a duplicate copy of the reverse string.
