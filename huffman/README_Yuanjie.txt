Comment: 

As the other "big" assignment comparable to DNA and Boggle, Huffman has its unique merits in that
the codes are able to do something pretty useful, i.e. compressing/uncompressing files. Partnership
really helps for this assignment, since the exam we took one week ago costed a lot of time for 
preparation. I wish we could have had the chance to collaborate on Boggle assignment, too.
