Comment:
The regular part of Jotto assignment is basically easy. However, the extra credits
are hard and take longer time to do. I've written a lot of codes, trying to play
smarter, though they doesn't really help much in reality. I guess the Smart/AI mode
is only advantageous in guessing particular words, which could be hard to run into 
by random chance. One standard to test whether the program is smarter or not is to
find out some of these words and run Jotto multiple times guessing them, so that
you have a statistical measurement of how different programs perform.
