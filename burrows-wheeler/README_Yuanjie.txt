Comment: 

The Burrows-Wheeler project is harder than Huffman in that the algorithm is pretty tricky and 
it takes me much time to go through the readings and fully understand it. However, once I 
figured how it works, the coding part is actually not heavy since a lot of codes are already 
there.
